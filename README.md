This was all in my efforts to examine the security of modern encryption (specifically RSA) as computers become more powerful. 
I basically found that with modern methods and classical (non-quantum) computers, theres no way to crack it no mater how fast the computer is.
Even getting every atom in the universe to do an iteration of Fermats factoring method (the fastes method i tested, dont tell my teachers there are supposedly faster ones 
such as general number field sieve and other things Carl Pomerance wrote a lot about) every milisecond it would take like 10^600 millenia...
quantum computers change tghinsg up a bit but then well just mopve to a differenty encryption method and I think well be fine
